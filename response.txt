Major Question & Comments


1) Model Assumptions and Uncertainties.

Section 2 of the paper describes how a violation of SEP eventually
leads to a displacement between the position of the stars and the
black hole, culminating in Equation (9).  However Eq. (9) does not
seem to be derived from the previous calculations in the paper.  I was
able to derive something similar to equation (9), assuming that the
black hole is found in a cored galaxy with constant density \rho_core:

x/d = (\Delta)/(\1 - \Delat) * (M_G / (4/3*pi * d^3)) * (1/\rho_core)   (*)

This was derived by setting the relative acceleration of the black
hole to the stars equal to the acceleration felt by the black hole if
displaced by a distance x.  Qualitatively this is similar to Equation
9, except the relative displacement depends on the average density of
the core of the galaxy - not the average density of the galaxy.

I could not derive a similar relative for the Hernquist profile. It
has no density core, but rather the density diverges as x -> 0.
Assuming that the profile is fixed (a poor assumption, but necessary),
the Hernquist profile results in roughly constant acceleration for x
<< a.

* We absolutely agree with this statement.  However, the mass of the stars
* that form the core is much smaller than the mass of the black hole, so
* we have used numerical simulations to understand the motion of the BH
* in the galactic potential.

M32 is a relatively dense galaxy, with extremely high stellar
densities near the radius of influence of the black hole.  From
Section 3, the value of rho_core assumed is effectively m / (4/3 pi
a^3) ~ 1000 Msun/pc^3.  From Lauer et al (1998: Fig. 17 of M32 +/- 1)
the stellar mass density near the radius of influence is ~ 10^5
Msun/pc^3.  This is 100x greater than assumed in the paper suggesting
that the model used overestimates the constraint on violations of SEP.
In Hui & Nichols (2012), the authors suggested searches in galaxies
with very low central densities.

Direct simulations modeling the M32 galaxy under acceleration should
be able to determine how well \Delta can be constrained assuming a
fixed geometry.  Without direct simulations, it is not clear what
constraints can be derived.

* We used the Hernquist profile to model the centres of the galaxies
* as previous researchers have done, to motivate the necessity of
* numerical models and to get the scaling of the restoring force on
* the hole with the properties of the galaxy.  The density at the
* centre of the Hernquist profile diverges and this formally yields an
* constant restoring force for a test mass.
*
* The mass of the black hole is typically large compared to the mass
* contained within the cusp, so the numerical simulations are required
* to determine the actual size of the restoring forces because the
* observed cusp in the centres of these galaxies is necessarily
* correlated with the black hole.  We used the numerical simulations
* to measure the strength of the restoring force due to the stars in
* the vicinity of the black hole but beyond the sphere of influence of
* the hole.  Of course, this is a difficult to define boundary which
* is why we use the simulations.  From the observed velocities near the
* black hole in M87, we loosely define a sphere of influence and find
* results similar to the numerical simulations.

2) Reported limits and uncertainties

The reported limits, especially if used in the abstract, should include the
appropriate range of uncertainty  (68% confidence, 95% confidence) owing to the
unknown geometry of the system (i.e. cos i), or other uncertainties (M_31).

* We have added the uncertainties to the discussion in the abstract
* and throughout.

Other comments and questions:

1) In Section 3, the authors refer to circular apertures.  Do they use full circles
including the cusp of stars in the center?  How would this change with annuli?  

* We used small circular apertures to localize the cusp itself or the AGN in
* M87.  We used elliptical annuli in the case of M32 to find the centre of 
* the light distribution.  These annuli did not include the light from the cusp.
* For M87, we used a circular annuli with the region along the jet and antijet
* removed.

2) Is Eq. 10 truley independent of distance?  For example, derived quantities such as M often depend on  distance as well.

* It is essentially independent of distance because it depends on angular sizes
* and on the ratio of masses, so the distance dependence drops out.  The largest
* uncertainties are of course the geometric factors.

3) Is \Delta > 1 already constrained by the presence of the BH in the centers of
galaxies?  I.e., when \Delta > 1, then the acceleration between the stars and black hole are repulsive.

* This is an excellent point, so we have removed the discussion of constraints 
* with Delta>1 because we already know that Delta<1.  We have added this point
* into the text after equation (5).

4) In Figure 2, it would be useful to see the expected direction of the acceleration
relative to the jet in M87.

* We have added a discussion of the locations of the nearby galaxies,
* M84 and M89 in the figure caption of Fig. 2.  M84 is to the right (west)
* and M89 is to the left (east).g


5) In section 2, the authors discuss the oscillation of the black hole
in the center of hernquist profiles.  Given |\Delta| >0, is the black
hole expected to be offset in a fixed position, or oscillate within
the potential? What occurs in numerical experiments?  The text is
unclear.

* One would expect that the black hole would be offset from the centre
* by constant amount because dynamical friction would damp the
* oscillatory behaviour so that the hole would lie at the centre of
* the combined potential.
